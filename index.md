## Behold! The Simple Linux Backup Recovery CLI

This program has a very basic ability to backup directories and restore from the backup; either a single file or the entire directory. 
The program has a forensic function that can recover some deleted files. This is just the cornerstone of something great to come for now. 
When I get some time, I am going to circle back and make this a beast of a backup-recovery-forensic program.
